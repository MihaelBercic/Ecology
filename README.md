# About

The INTRuST Coaching Tool is a web-based tool designed to help improve certification skills by the forestry, furniture and woodworking industry. This digital guidance tool will allow industries and other stakeholders to know what certification schemes are the most suitable and then suggest the appropriate training content to study in each case. 
The tool selects appropriate and personalized training content for learners based on their specific background, needs and interests. Together with the INTRuST Collaborative e-learning platform, the tool provides personalized training pathways, Industry 4.0 technology recommendations, and guidance on how to improve certification skills. These tools help companies obtain certifications, reduce implementation costs, and digitize their value chain, fostering competitiveness among EU wood-related companies.


# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
